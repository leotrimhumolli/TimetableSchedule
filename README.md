# TimetableSchedule Generator

Timetable creation is a very important and time consuming task for the university. We were asked in the Artificial Intelligence to create a small application to generate the best timetable schedule for the university.
I have used the Genetic Algorithm for this problem and created a java project as required.


In order to run you have to import the project on NetBeans or in any other editor and in the src package to run the main file (Databaza.java)
