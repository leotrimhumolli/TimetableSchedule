# TimetableSchedule Generator

Timetable creation is a very important and time consuming task for the university. We were asked in the Artificial Intelligence to create a small application to generate the best timetable schedule for the university.
I have used the Genetic Algorithm for this problem and created a java project as required.


In order to run you have to run the databaza.java file.
